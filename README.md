### Class Project Guidelines

The group project consists of carrying out a thorough regression analysis of a data set of your choice, for which linear or logistic regression is appropriate. The main aim is to do a good analysis.

The components of the project are as follows:

1. Finding data sets and setting up project groups.
2. A  short in-class presentation (7-10 minutes depending on the number of projects) of your chosen topic on the assigned dates (check the schedules and announcements). Counts for 15%. 
3. Feedback from 2 peer groups will be worth 5%. 
4. Final poster presentation 15%. Poster presentations will take place during the scheduled final exam slot at a location to be announced later.

### Group 5 Project Background & Goal

This projects explore changes in a California marine ecosystem and relates those changes to ocean conditions, by taking advantage of the extensive publicly-available data sets collected by the Santa Barbara Channel Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program. 

Marine ecosystems are subject to natural variability in environmental conditions, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, as well as a variety of anthropogenic pressures including climate change and coastal development. Long-term data sets are critical for understanding how marine ecosystems change – or do not change – over time and space. The Santa Barbara Channel is a particularly interesting location for analyzing temporal changes in marine ecosystems because it is a transition zone between the cold waters of the California Current and the warmer waters of Southern California. This results in a high diversity of marine organisms that are strongly influenced by the physical and chemical characteristics of the water. 

#### Research Questions

How are oceanographic conditions and herbivore abundance correlated with giant kelp size and abundance?
How does fish community abundance and diversity vary according to giant kelp size and abundance, and oceanographic conditions?

#### Variables

Kelp Abundance: Kelp fronds / m, by transect (replicate) and site

Kelp Size: Diameter of the kelp holdfast, by transect (replicate) and site. *Only measured for large observed Macrocystis individuals with holdfast > 20cm*

Fish Species Richness: Number of different fish species present, by transect (replicate) and site. Calculated as: Richness = number of species / sqrt(number of individuals)

Fish Species Abundance: Diversity of fish species present, by transect (replicate) and site. Calculated as: Shannon index = ∑ (pl) |ln pl|, Where (pl) is the proportion of the total number of individuals in the population that are in species “l”.

Invertebrate Species Richness

Invertebrate Species Abundance

Urchin Abundance: individuals / m, by transect (replicate) and site. Urchins are herbivores that eat kelp; they have played a large role in the decline of kelp forests. 



#### Covariates (Biological Community)

Site: Sampling site. There are eight coastal sites included in this data set. 

Year: Year of sampling. In the data, sampling was conducted from 2001-2018. 

Month: Month the survey was conducted. 

Observer: Who conducted the survey.
