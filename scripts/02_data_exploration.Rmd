## Data 

Kelp data
```{r}
kelp <- read.csv(here::here("data","Annual_Kelp_MeanSize_MeanAbund_2001-2018.csv"))
```
<br>

Fish community data
```{r}
fish <- read.csv(here::here("data","Annual_Fish_RichnessAbundDiversity_2001-2018.csv"))
```
<br>

Combine data sets
```{r}
sbc <- left_join(kelp,fish)
```
<br>





## Question 1

How does fish / invertebrate community abundance and diversity vary according to giant kelp size and abundance, and oceanographic conditions?

```{r}
```
